To get the code running in your machine, Login to https://newsdata.io/ 
After login create your own new API key from menu bar on website.
and use this GET resquest URL- [https://newsdata.io/api/1/news?apikey=pub_437242489f236aed819a675c35e0c0c5a452f&q=YOUR_QUERY].
This is a free version of NEWS API so it can only get the request of 10 articles on your page, Paid members can display 50 aticles on a single page.
you can use additional parameters into the GET request URL like language & date of artiles showing, many articles are in different languages so I recommend to use Language prameter.

OK That's it Now enjoy your free NEWS fetching website or project.
Thankyou.
